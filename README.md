# A talking toucan
A little website building experience, using blogdown on R to create the site, and Netlify to deploy it. I'm using the [Academic](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/) template, as well as [Alison Hill's theme and font](https://github.com/rbind/apreshill) because it's pretty and I have no inspiration.

I mainly followed Alison Hill's blogpost ["Up & running with blogdown in 2021""](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/) and looked a bit at [*blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Hill.

What do I have planned ?

- [x] changing the favicon.
- [ ] updating my experience.
- [x] cleaning out the rest of the templates.
- [x] doing my own CSS theme! (kiiiinda did it)
- [x] creating landing pages to alleviate my homepage of widgets.
- [ ] writing stuff ðŸ˜¬
