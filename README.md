# mission-website
A little website building experience, using blogdown on R to create the site, and Netlify to deploy it. I'm using the [Academic](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/) theme.

Based mainly on Alison Hill's [blogpost](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/) and on [*blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Hill.

What do I have planned ?

- [ ] changing the favicon.
- [ ] updating my experience.
- [ ] cleaning out the rest of the templates.
- [ ] doing my own CSS theme!
- [ ] writing stuff ðŸ˜¬
