# A talking toucan
A website building experience, using `blogdown` on R to create the site, and Netlify to deploy it. I'm using the [Academic](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/) template, and I was heavily inspired by [Alison Hill's theme and font and lots of other stuff](https://github.com/rbind/apreshill) for the look of my website, because it's pretty and I have no creativity.

I followed her blogpost ["Up & running with blogdown in 2021""](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/) and looked a bit at [*blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Hill.
