I am an overly curious postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences. I enjoy learning new tools and ways of sharing beautiful content, to help myself and others better understand things. With these traits in mind, I built a [website](https://pyrrhamide.github.io/regressions) with `bookdown`, reporting all the different data analysis methods I learned during my postgraduate degree.

I love experimenting with R and RMarkdown, I am always on the lookout for new packages to play with, hence I cannot stop building new projects. This website is my latest creation, and with it, I aim to:

* Regularly post content about data analysis and about content creation with R -- with the exceptional personal article -- in English as well as in [French](/fr/#about),
* Learn HTML and CSS in the process of further customising _**a talking toucan**_!

Thank you very much for reading, I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!
