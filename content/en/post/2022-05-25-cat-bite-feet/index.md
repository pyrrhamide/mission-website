Sometimes (a lot of times), you browse Reddit and you discover a new subreddit. You sort posts by best, and you find some amazing stories.

I've become obsessed with [r/BestOfRedditorUpdates](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/) this past week, and I found one of the funniest thing. I thought I'd share it here.

For the record, I don't trust cats (YTC, cat. This is assault). Nonetheless, this post was too cute and too funny not to share.
