  I like :
  
  <i class="fas fa-football-ball pr2"></i> Rugby (union, duh). I played for one year and it now defines me.

  <i class="fas fa-gem pr2"></i> Reality TV. _Vanderpump Rules, Love Island, Top Chef, Real Housewives_...my type on paper.

  <i class="fas fa-cocktail pr2"></i> Tattoos. Truly. I love them. Unfortunely I could not find an appropriate icon for this, hence why the cocktail. I like mojitos!

  <i class="fas fa-hat-wizard pr2"></i> I love experimenting with R and other web thingies. It feels like magic.

  <i class="fas fa-glass-cheers pr2"></i>Sincere thanks to [MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu/) for her help naming this Hugo theme!
