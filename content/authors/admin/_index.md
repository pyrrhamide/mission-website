I am an overly curious postgraduate student in Quantified Social Sciences. I enjoy continuously learning new stuff, to help myself and others better understand things. I built a [website](pyrrhamide.github.io/regressions) with bookdown, reporting all the different methods I learned during my postgraduate degree, in order to help my classmates who struggled the most with R and methods.

I love experimenting with R and RMarkdown, I cannot stop building new projects, the latest one being this lovely website (it is still a work in progress, bear with me!). I would very much like to regularly post content on here, right after I get the hang of Hugo and blogdown!
